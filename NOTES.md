# NOTES — objections and out-of-scope proposals

Per PLAN.md work rule 6: features not in PLAN.md are recorded here as
proposals, not code. Objections to the plan are recorded here and the plan
is followed anyway.

## Deviations recorded at setup (2026-06-13)

- **Scheduling mechanism.** PLAN.md prefers Claude Code's built-in scheduled
  tasks (`/schedule` Routines) and falls back to a crontab entry. This project
  is hosted in Claude Code on the web, where each session runs in an ephemeral
  container: a crontab written here would vanish when the container is
  reclaimed, and Routines cannot be registered from inside a session. The
  durable equivalent chosen instead is a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow
  (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`) running Claude Code headless with the
  verbatim NIGHTLY_PROMPT.md, scoped to `--allowedTools "Read,Edit,Write,Bash"`
  as the plan specifies. Requires the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret (or
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) — see README. The operator may alternatively
  register a Routine from the Claude Code UI pointing at this repo with the
  same prompt; if so, disable the workflow to avoid double runs.
